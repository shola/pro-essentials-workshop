# TypeScript In The Browser

## Learning Goals

- Learn how you can use TypeScript to build web apps

## Problem

Try opening the `index.html` file in your browser. You'll see that it doesn't work. Why is that?

- Because browsers can't load raw typescript files. They need to be transpiled to javascript.
